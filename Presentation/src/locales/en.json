This option can be activated with a klick on the 'Allow rerolls' box and entering the number of times each member can reroll in the field 'Number of possible rerolls' below. (Attention, the currently drawn partner can also be drawn again). By clicking on 'Next' you will be asked to enter the name or a pseudonym for each member. No name / pseudonym may appear more than once in a group. By clicking on 'Create' the group gets created and you get displayed all the information. On the top you get the group name and below a list with all the members and for each member the name and corresponding key (Can be shown by clicking on the eye icon). Now you only have to send each member their data (group name, name, key) and everyone can start drawing a partner for themselves. Caution: Also write down your groupkey! You will need this key if you want to visit all the detailed information of your group again with the 'Show group' menu point. With a click on 'Finish' the data gets closed",

It can be rerolled as long as it was specified when the group was created. How many dolls are left can be seen by the small number on the right top corner of the button. If a suitable partner has been drawn, you can confirm this partner by clicking on the 'Accept' button. After 5 minutes the drawn partner is automatically accepted for you. If the partner is accepted, you cannot draw again. If you have forgotten your partner, you can re-enter your credentials at any time and your assigned partner will be displayed again.",
