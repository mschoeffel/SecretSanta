This option can be activated with a klick on the 'Allow rerolls' box and entering the number of times each member can reroll in the field 'Number of possible rerolls' below. (Attention, the currently drawn partner can also be drawn again). By clicking on 'Next' you will be asked to enter the name or a pseudonym for each member. No name / pseudonym may appear more than once in a group. By clicking on 'Create' the group gets created and you get displayed all the information. On the top you get the group name and below a list with all the members and for each member the name and corresponding key (Can be shown by clicking on the eye icon). Now you only have to send each member their data (group name, name, key) and everyone can start drawing a partner for themselves. With a click on 'Finish' the data gets closed",

    "drawmember-content": "Enter the creadentials of a member, which are assigned to each member when creating a group. If the are entered correctly, a partner from the group is assigned to the member and the name of the corresponding partner gets displayed. If the option of rerolls was given when the group was created, a member can reroll his/her partner wit a click on 'Reroll'. Attention, the same partner can be drawn again. It can be rerolled as long as it was specified when the group was created. How many dolls are left can be seen by the small number on the right top corner of the button. If a suitable partner has been drawn, you can confirm this partner by clicking on the 'Accept' button. After 5 minutes the drawn partner is automatically accepted for you. If the partner is accepted, you cannot draw again. If you have forgotten your partner, you can re-enter your credentials at any time and your assigned partner will be displayed again."
